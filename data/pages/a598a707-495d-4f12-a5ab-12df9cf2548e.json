Flint’s direct voice channeling was rigorously tested throughout his 40+ years as an active medium; researchers and skeptics would attend his seances to tape over his mouth, affix sensors and microphones to his throat to detect vibrations, or to measure the volume of water Flint could hold in his mouth before, during, and after a seance. Flint was regularly recorded and tested by the London-based Society for Psychical Research (SPR), which boasted cutting-edge parapsychological testing technologies, including infrared telescopes and cameras and tamper-proof cabinets for mediums to perform inside of.

The quality of the voices of the deceased during Flint's seances were a critique frequently lobbed by skeptics, but in this instance, Doyle names the apparent change in his speaking voice as a condition of his credibility; of course speak impediments don't exist in the perfection of the afterlife. Again, I'm not particularly concerned with whether or how our personal beliefs align with these claims, but hope to engage what they offer our understandings of the rhetoricity of embodiment. "
