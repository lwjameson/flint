The new-materialist turn in rhetoric opens up the study of language and meaning beyond language itself (or entextualized meaning): in the (relatively recent and certainly in-process) material-discursive tradition, attention to meaning making requires attention to materiality, and how matter and meaning interact to form realities (notable schools of thought I'm thinking with here are the post-humanists, like Haraway, Hayles, Bennett, and Barad; feminisms concerned with the body, like Butler, Chávez, and Ahmed; and the rhetorical move towards praxiography, like Teston, Graham, and Mol).
